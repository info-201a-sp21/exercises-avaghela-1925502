# Exercise 1
In this exercise you'll practice using git to clone and edit repositories, as will be required for later exercises.

1. If you haven't already, configure your name and email address for your GitHub account using the terminal.

  git config --global user.name "Arjun Vaghela"

2. If you haven't already create your own version of this repository on GitHub by using the link to using GitHub Classroom.

  Complete

3. Using the terminal, clone **your version** of the repository to your machine (make sure you're in the desired directory on your terminal).

  cd Desktop

  cd "Info 201"

  git clone https://github.com/info-201a-sp21/exercises-avaghela-1925502


4. On your machine, open up this file (`exercise-1/README.md`) in a text editor of your choice.

  I have opened the File in Atom

5. In the `README.md` file, below these instructions, add an ordered list of what you ate for breakfast today.

        1. Pancakes
        2. Milk
        3. Hash browns
        4. Chai

6. Using your terminal, add and commit the changes you've made to your repository

  add .
  commit -m "updated changes made to the answers"

7. Push changes up to GitHub, and view them in your web browser. Make sure you are looking at the repository under _your_ account!

  git push
